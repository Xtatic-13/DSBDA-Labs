      "Review:Having disposed off my old HCL laptop of 2009 vintage, I was quite restless without one for a long time. This machine is Fast, wonderful and versatile. I am still to master the features which are like never ending ones. As a retired senior citizen I find it a very good company along with my wife and a few good friends.\n",

      "Review:I bought this laptop 3 years back and am facing several issues1. Durability: I have an old Dell Laptop for last 10 years , but the Inspiron purchase in last 3 years has shaken my confidence in Dell.2. Keyboard: I had to twice change my keyboard for 2600INR each.3. Dell display cable is faulty hence you can position laptop in a particular position only. In other position screen blinks.4. I had to change the laptop charger and now the battery is giving end of life (after 3 years!!!!) message.5. Performance - It does not run even simple programs - I had to replace RAM to improve performance.\n",

      "Review:I would never buy a laptop online again. The service is very poor. The start button got stuck within 1 year ( which was within the warranty period) and when I contacted amazon, they asked me to contact DELL. When I contacted DELL they told the warranty had expired, even though it was less than one year since I purchased the laptop. They wanted amazon to go and RESET something on their system. A long sequence of phone calls happened.Basically Amazon and DELL were passing the responsibility to each other. Amazon offered to get back to me but NEVER did. I did not bother them after that as it was my work laptop and I needed it urgently. So, I got someone else to fix it. Unfortunately, the button is stuck again and I was told that this is a common problem with this model. I am not sure how true it is, but the gist of it that you do not get any support when things go wrong with your laptop.\n",

It is better to procure the laptops directly from manufacturer under appropriate warranty cover. Buying from re-sellers is a big challenge managing it over the life of product.\n",
